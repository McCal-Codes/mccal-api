# Manifest Utilities

This folder contains API utilities for manifest synchronization and management.

## Purpose

These scripts help the API:
- Sync manifests from the website repo (when used as a submodule)
- Validate manifest structure for API consumption
- Cache warming and manifest preprocessing

## Note

**Manifest generation** happens in the McCals-Website repository. This API repo consumes those manifests.

If you need to generate or update manifests, see the website repo at:
- `McCals-Website/scripts/manifest/`

## Available Scripts

(To be added as API-specific manifest utilities are created)
