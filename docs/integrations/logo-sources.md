## ⚖️ Legal Considerations:

1. **Fair Use**: Editorial/news logos often fall under fair use
2. **Permission**: Best practice is to ask permission
3. **Attribution**: Consider adding small attribution if required
4. **Trademark**: Don't modify official logos significantly

## 🔄 Next Steps:

1. Start with the major ones (NY Post, Pittsburgh Magazine, Point Park)
2. Use Wikipedia Commons for well-known organization logos
3. Contact organizations directly for official logo files
4. Test all logos in your widget before going live
5. Keep placeholder logos as backup options
