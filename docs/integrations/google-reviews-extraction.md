# Google Maps Reviews Integration Guide

## 🔍 How to Extract Your Google Maps Reviews

### Method 1: Manual Copy-Paste
1. **Visit your Google Maps link**: https://maps.app.goo.gl/CKztLDxynn6mwSwS8
2. **Scroll down** to the reviews section
3. **Copy the best reviews** - focus on:
   - 4-5 star reviews
   - Reviews with specific details about your photography work
   - Reviews that mention your professionalism, quality, etc.
   - Recent reviews (within last 1-2 years)

### Method 2: Screenshot and Manual Entry
1. **Take screenshots** of the best reviews
2. **Type them out manually** (ensures accuracy and no formatting issues)
3. **Note the reviewer's name and rating**

## 📝 Review Format for Website

For each review, collect:
```
★★★★★ (star rating)
"Review text here..."
- Reviewer Name (optional: add "Google Review" designation)
```

## 🎯 What to Look For:

**Best reviews mention:**
- Quality of your photography work
- Professionalism and punctuality
- Specific events or shoots you did
- Positive experience working with you
- Results/final photos they received
- Your communication skills
- Value for money

**Avoid reviews that:**
- Are too generic ("great photographer")
- Don't mention specific services
- Are outdated (older than 2-3 years)
- Have low ratings (below 4 stars)

## 🔄 Once You Have the Reviews:

### Step 1: Create Review Data
```javascript
const testimonials = [
  {
    rating: 5,
    text: "Caleb did an amazing job photographing our corporate event. His professionalism and attention to detail were outstanding. The photos captured every important moment perfectly.",
    author: "Sarah Johnson",
    designation: "Event Coordinator"
  },
  {
    rating: 5, 
    text: "Working with Caleb was a fantastic experience. He made everyone comfortable and the photos turned out incredible. Highly recommend for any photography needs!",
    author: "Mike Chen",
    designation: "Client"
  }
  // Add more reviews...
];
```

### Step 2: I'll Update the About Page
Once you provide the reviews, I'll:
- Replace the placeholder testimonials with your real Google reviews
- Add proper star ratings display
- Include reviewer names and designations
- Optimize the layout for multiple reviews
- Add "Google Reviews" branding where appropriate
